# Pneumothorax-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Approach
This project focuses on binary classification of pneumothorax from chest X-ray images using deep learning. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with far fewer pneumothorax cases than normal images. To tackle this, we applied data preprocessing, augmentation, and class weighting to improve model performance on the minority class
